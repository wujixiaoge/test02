## Key Features ✨  
### 🚦 **Smart Query Routing**  
StrataAI dynamically evaluates each query's complexity, type, and context to route it to the best-fit AI engine—whether it's for language understanding, image recognition, data analysis, or custom tasks.  
### ⚡ **Efficiency at Scale**  
Eliminate latency and resource wastage. StrataAI minimises the time and computational overhead by optimising the query-engine pairing process.  
### 🌐 **Multi-Engine Compatibility**  
Connect with multiple AI platforms, including OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, Hugging Face, and custom in-house models.  
### 🔒 **Enterprise-Grade Security**  
StrataAI ensures data integrity and privacy with advanced encryption, secure APIs, and compliance with major regulatory standards (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).  
### 📊 **Analytics and Insights**  
Track query performance and engine efficiency through rich analytics dashboards, helping you fine-tune your AI stack.
